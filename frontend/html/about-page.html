            <h2>Our Mission</h2>
            <p>At MediLink, our mission is to improve the quality of post-operative care by connecting patients, caregivers, and healthcare providers 
                through an integrated and user-friendly platform. We believe in supporting patients beyond the hospital, 
                providing them with the resources and tools necessary to ensure a safe and smooth recovery journey. 
                By reducing the challenges of at-home recovery and offering a network of support, we aim to reduce 
                readmissions and complications, allowing patients to focus on healing and returning to their daily lives.</p>

        <div class="section" id="problem">
            <h2>The Problem</h2>
            <p>Recovering from surgery is often a complex and challenging experience for patients and their caregivers. 
                Many patients are discharged from the hospital with complex care instructions, medications, diet restrictions, 
                and activity limitations, making it difficult for them and their families to manage the recovery process. 
                Caregivers, who are often family members without formal medical training, may struggle to properly care for their loved ones. 
                This lack of structured support can lead to missed medications, inadequate wound care, and delayed recognition of complications, 
                increasing the risk of rehospitalization and slower recovery times. Additionally, doctors are often overburdened 
                with managing numerous patients, which can make it difficult to monitor each patient's post-operative progress effectively.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section" id="solution">
            <h2>Our Solution</h2>
            <p>MediLink addresses these challenges by providing a comprehensive web platform designed specifically for post-operative care. 
                Our solution allows patients and caregivers to easily access tailored recovery plans, including medication reminders, 
                diet guidelines, activity recommendations, and symptom tracking tools. Doctors and healthcare providers can 
                efficiently monitor each patientâ€™s progress, review daily symptom logs, and communicate directly with patients 
                through a secure chat feature. In addition, the platform includes a FAQ section to address common recovery questions 
                and a motivational quote generator to support patients' mental well-being. By streamlining communication and monitoring, 
                MediLink aims to make the recovery process as smooth and stress-free as possible for everyone involved.</p>
